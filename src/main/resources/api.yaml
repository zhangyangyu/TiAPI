  description: "TiAPI is a standalone service providing restful API to execute SQL statements on TiDB to users. It's an experimental project making TiDB more serviceless. With TiAPI, the real TiDB instances are transparent to end users. This frees users from management duties of database instances and offers more flexibility to the database providers of upgrading and other management things."
